I was born in Denmark in 1987 and is currently living in Copenhagen with my partner and former fellow student Morten Lunde. <br>I recently finished a master's degree in Geology-Geoscience at the University of Copenhagen with focus in palaeontology. During my studies I especially developed an affection for microorganisms resulting in a bachelor and master thesis concerning the nannofossils in the Cretaceous chalks of Denmark. <br>In my spare time I enjoy exploring the nature around me or to be creative  working with different materials. A combination of the two is however always preferred in particular in collaboration with friends and family. I am not afraid of trying new things as I believe that is the fastest way to evolve and progress. "
